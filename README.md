# mazedoer

Python script that takes a 2D array (maze) as input and attempts to solve it (find the exit) using DFS implemented using recursioon. Squares marked with "#" are walls and those with "." are empty (can traverse them), "S" is the start point and "E" is the end point. Solution shown graphically using PyGame module. 

I decided to begin working on this because I wanted to gain more experiences with data structures and algorithms, and I believed that working with a direct application of DFS would be a good starting point.
